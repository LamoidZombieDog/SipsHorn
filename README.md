**I Just want the dumb extension not any of this code mumbo jumbo**

Download this [SipsHorn.crx](https://github.com/kerpow/SipsHorn/blob/master/SipsHorn.crx?raw=true) and drag and drop it onto Chrome's extension page.

**Jeez, why don't you just put this up on the Chrome extension store marketplace thing?**

That costs $5! What am I? Made of money!?
